# Image-Visualizer
a pygame program written with assistance of claude.ai

This program let's you add images by dragging them onto the interface, then connecting images together by dragging them onto one another. Connections can be broken by dragging previously connected images onto one another. The current example is using pokemon. 

Things to Fix:
- Connection breaking seems to be one sided, so if one direction doesn't break it currently we have to try the other direction. 

Things to Implement:
- File and system Menus
- Graph Paper like Grid?
- Dark Mode
- Thicker Connection Lines and/or animation of the lines pulsing
- move images into folders based on connections
- rename images
- add corresponding text file for image, edit text file, show text as tooltip
    - click on image and keep it selected, while selected show tooltip
- auto loading
- multiple instances to be saved and loaded
- larger canvas area, can click and drag to see it or use arrow keys or wasd keys
- grouping, like a circular area that surrounds groups of images?
- many to many connections?
